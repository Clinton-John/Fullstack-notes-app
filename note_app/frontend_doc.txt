create a new react project using react
npm create vite@latest frontend --template react

After starting the project, move to the directory and install the following packages 

CREATING THE DATABASE 
Login to choreo >> dependancies >> database 
create a new database and copy paste the credentials given to a .env file in the django backend 

Now connect the database to django and provision it using the python manage.py file 
settings.py >>
    pip install dotenv
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()

    now the database is set to the new file 
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.getenv("DB_NAME"),
        'USER': os.getenv("DB_USER"),
        'HOST' : os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv("DB_PWD"),
        'PORT':os.getenv("DB_PORT")
        # 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        # 'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
    }
This configures the database and running it makes it work perfectly 
run python manage.py migrate 
after setting teh environment variables, run teh server and the project should run as expected 

BACKEND DEPLOYMENT 
To deploy the backend, you have to create a git repository to allow for the continous deployment 

in the note_app which is the backend, create a new folder .choreo
create a new file endpoints.yaml 
This is where we will add the end points that should expose and that we want to show from this backend 
version 0.1

endpoints.yaml >>> inside the .choreo folder 
    endpoints:
    - name: "REST API"
        port: 8000
        type: REST
        networkVisibility: Public
        context: /

create a new file known as Procfile in the root folder
Procfile >>>
    it specifies the command to execute our website and make it running 
    web: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    This is the command that will be executed when the backend is deployed and shows that the website can run on any public IP address 

The github repository must be set to public because choreo only allows working with public repositories
